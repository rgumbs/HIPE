# R script for function to calculate Human-Impacted Terminal Endemism (HITE) and Terminal Endemism (TE) 
# Function returns a dataframe of HITE and TE values for each species, along with range size in grid cells and 
#     Human Pressure weighting across each range

# input data:
# 'tree' must be a phylogentic tree of class phylo or phylo4 comprising all species for which HIPE is to be calculated
# 'cont' must be a dataframe with three columns: "X","Y","species", where each row is the X and Y coordinate for the centroid 
#     of a grid cell in a species' range. The 'cont' object must contain all grid cells in which a species occurs as individual 
#     rows and the species in the 'cont' must match the species in the tree object.
# 'hfp.points' must be a dataframe in the same format as 'cont', with three columnns: (1) "X", (2) "Y" (centroids of grid cells 
#     in the same projection and resolution as the 'cont' object), and (3) "HFP2009" (the Human Footprint value for each grid cell 
#     between 0-50).
# 'categories' must be a dataframe with two columns: (1) "HFP" and (2) "Score", and 51 rows, with the HFP column containing all 
#     51 HF calues (0-50) and each row of the "Score" column having the corresponding weighting (between 0 and 1) for the HF value 
#     on the row (e.g. in Gumbs et al. 2019 a HF value of 0 = score of 1, whereas HF of 50 = score of 0.2)
# 'grid.cell.area' must be a numeric representing the area of each grid cell in the analysis HITE and TE will then be 
#     calculated in this unit of area
